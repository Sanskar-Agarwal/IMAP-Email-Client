# IMAP Email Client
 This project involves developing an IMAP email client in C that can connect to an email server, authenticate a user, and perform various operations such as fetching, parsing, and listing emails. The client supports retrieving full emails or specific parts like headers and bodies, and it handles MIME types for email content.
